                        Using persuasive design methods, our team worked to create an intervention to help drive
                        non-Black allies to take a more proactive role to fight anti-Black racism. We created an
                        accountability app that generates different actions for allies to take based on weekly goals.
                        By completing tasks and meeting their monthly goals, allies can raise money to donate to the
                        anti-racism organization of their choice.

                        Originally, our team had decided to specifically target non-Black college students for our
                        intervention. I facilitated a focus group with four graduate students from colleges in
                        Pittsburgh in which the participants selected metaphors that reflected their perspectives on
                        various concepts related to racial bias and discrimination on college campuses. Through this
                        exercise, we found that students are uncertain about what specific or concrete steps to take to
                        engage in anti-racist work. As a result, we see a lack of action and participation from
                        students despite strong support to combat anti-Black racism. We planned to further explore the
                        shared disconnect between attitude and behavior.

                        In continuing research on allyship, I conducted an interview with a graduate student and member
                        of our target audience. We discussed the larger systemic racism built into settings like schools
                        and hospitals. When it came to their own social sphere, however, my participant echoed the
                        sentiment of other interviewees that addressing racism within their own social sphere was a
                        challenge. They weren't sure of the exact actions to take to address that, but acknowledged that
                        it was something they wanted to improve.

                        As a team, we also conducted interviews with various experts in the field of diversity and
                        racial bias. We discussed the challenges BIPOC students face, student campus resources, pain
                        points with these resources, and effective/ineffective allyship. One emerging theme that was
                        discussed was the need for allies to step out of their comfort zones and make a conscious effort
                        to engage with and expand their typical social circle.

                        After conducting the user and expert interviews, we had initially decided to create an
                        intervention aimed at reducing racial bias on college campuses and motivating non-Black students
                        who view themselves as allies (or recognize racial bias as an ongoing issue) to take concrete
                        action against racism. We began to generate design ideas centered around encouraging more
                        meaningful relationship between racially-diverse groups of students. As many of our ideas could
                        be used in a larger context, however, we decided to expand our target audience to all motivated
                        non-Black allies.

                        <li>Our plan is for an incentivized app that breaks down allyship into manageable tasks.
                            This app will emulate that by giving users a choice of how they’d like to be active in the
                            Black Lives Matter movement - through donating, educating themselves, e-mailing officials,
                            etc. It will then provide them with a task to complete or
                            an article to read by the end of that week. Users will be further motivated by the ability
                            to buy furniture, grow their forest, gain badges, or other artifacts as they complete more
                            activities. In addition to the manageable tasks feature on the app, the app would have an
                            additional “on this day” feature that notifies users of specific race-related historical
                            incident, movement, or other POC’s effort that happened on that same day.</li>
                        <li>The setting of the game would be a post-apocalyptic world where the player is the main
                            character and must work with others to survive. In one of the research papers the group
                            read, a recommended strategy to engage allies is to encourage them to put others’ needs
                            before their own and to reduce uncertainty in their ability to evaluate and confirm racist
                            incidents. In the game, we would place the player in uncertain circumstances and steer them
                            to put their needs before their team’s at the beginning of the game, which would lead to
                            repeated failure. We would eventually steer the player to be more team-oriented, and begin
                            to shift their priorities to helping others and becoming more secure in their evaluations
                            of different scenarios.

                            After talking to our experts, we learned that it’s important for allies to integrate with
                            different groups. We also learned from our users that they have a desire to diversify their
                            social circles but do not know where to start. So our second idea is a web/app service
                            similar to Airbnb Online Experiences where hosts share their hobbies, stories, or skills
                            with guests. The guest chooses a category they’re interested in and the app/website pairs
                            the guest with a host who offers an experience in that category. The goal is to create
                            shared experiences between people of diverse backgrounds and offer a starting point for
                            relationships to form. By pairing up diverse people together, the platform can help
                            re-establish ingroups by drawing focus on people’s shared interests and help break down
                            racial biases. Ultimately, by creating moments of connection, our users can find common
                            ground and build empathy.
