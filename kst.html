                        Kelly Strayhorn Theater, located in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh, uses creative
                        programming to bring together diverse audiences. With the recent COVID-19 pandemic, however,
                        they have been limited in the their ability to bring live events to audiences. KST partnered
                        with our User-Centered Research and Evaluation class to find ways to increase audience
                        engagement, donations, and attendance at events while maintaining the safety and health of its
                        patrons.<br><br>

                       My team worked to create a community-based website for virtual events. Participants can directly
                       contact hosts and other attendees, thereby fostering more fulfilling experiences and engagement.

                        the Design Lead on our project, and was responsible for generating ideas for solutions that
                        addressed user needs as well as guiding the prototyping process.

                        Our team evaluated attendance compared to marketing method used and the types of events that KST
                        audience members want to see in the future. We hypothesized that by investing into social media
                        campaigns, there is potential to increase engagement with smaller events. Additionally,
                        despite the fact that KST primarily focuses on dance performances, audiences still wanted to see
                        more dance programming. Our team wondered if there was a gap in KST's marketing such that
                        audiences don't know about other dance performances, events, or classes.

                        We decided to complete a diverse range of activities so that we could get a comprehensive idea
                        of the scope of theater and performing arts events. KST is a nonprofit theater that has been
                        experiencing low engagement levels. The low engagement levels have been exacerbated by the
                        pandemic. KST may be able to innovate with digital experiences to increase engagement.
                        For example, using Twitch to livestream performances.

                        After collecting our team's stakeholder and customer journey maps, storyboards, and prototypes,
                        we began to define our project. Almost every role in the theater will be impacted by the COVID-19
                        pandemic, but there were now opportunities for audiences to take on a more active role in the
                        theater's programming. We decided to pursue this new problem space to create some sort of
                        platform for patrons to connect with artists, particularly in non-performance events like
                        workshops or classes.

                        To begin our user research, our team had participants think aloud as they found a virtual event to
                        attend on AirBnb's website. We were interested in learning more about how participants choose
                        which events to attend, including the format, date, price, platform, and activity that they
                        will be completing. There were overlaps in usability problems with the site, including the fact
                        that many users generally relied on filters to search through and find events that met their
                        criteria, but were selective with which type of event to attend and hesitant about paying for a
                        virtual event. Our key takeaways were:<br>
                    </p>
                    <ul class="text">
                        <li>When creating virtual events for KST, we need to keep the event’s value proposition in mind
                            and make sure that it is promoted according to the value proposition.</li>
                        <li>We should also carefully consider the virtual platform used and try to
                            mimic an in-person experience as much as possible.</li>
                        <li>Finally, we should consider how events
                            are displayed on KST’s website and how users can filter through the events.

                        To learn more about the host's experience with the transition to virtual classes, we interviewed
                        five teachers who utilize various platforms to teach classes, as well as the pain points (and
                        what is going well) for the artists/streamers. How artists define a successful virtual event was
                        also a key insight for us to gauge how streaming platforms may contribute to or inhibit the
                        potential of a virtual class. Our key takeaways are as follows:
                    </p>
                        <ul class="text">
                            <li>Technological difficulties and limitations significantly reduce the quality of the event
                                and the host’s ability to effectively host the event.</li>
                            <li>Although hosts are willing to try a variety of strategies to increase participation,
                                audience engagement in virtual events is still a challenge.</li>
                            <li>Pre-event promotion is a large factor in determining audience size and audience
                                engagement during the event.</li>
                            <li>Virtual events create more opportunities for increased accessibility and creativity.</li>
                            <li>Setting clear expectations and goals can help reduce the host’s anxiety when planning
                                and preparing for virtual events, and draw in a larger audience.</li>

                        After conducting another Walk the Wall session, our team created sixteen storyboards of
                        potential solutions to user needs that varied in level of risk. We then presented these
                        situations to various users to learn more and uncover their needs.

                        <li>For recurring events, participants have a strong desire to build long-term rapport with the
                            host and other attendees.</li>
                        <li>Participants are uncertain about expectations at virtual events, and they rely on the
                            behavior of other attendees to decide what the social norms to follow.</li>
                        <li>Participants would like to attend events with people they are already comfortable with to
                            chat and ask questions during the event.</li>
